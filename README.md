# FEEDBACK-APP
🚀 Just built a simple Full-Stack Feedback App using React & Node.js!
🔧 Tech Stack:
* Frontend: React.js (with Hooks & Functional Components)
* Backend: Node.js + Express.js (REST API)
* Styling: Pure CSS (Custom theme: Light Pink & Light Maroon 🎨)
  
📝 Features:
- Submit user feedback via form
- View a list of feedback entries
- Delete feedback individually
- Clean and responsive UI with themed colors

💡 This project helped me understand:
React state management with useState and useEffect
Making API calls using fetch()
Setting up a basic Node.js + Express backend

Creating a clean, styled UI without external libraries
📸 Here’s a sneak peek!
